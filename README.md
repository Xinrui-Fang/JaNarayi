Intensive listening and shadowing are two efficient ways for non-native spearkers to learn a new language.
As a international student studying in Japan, I am struggling to search Japanese listening and reading materials online. Sometimes, it is easy for us to find good Japanese study materials, but unfortunately without captions and translations. Thus, I am considering to develope such a web application that allow us post Japanese listening materials to the server, and let server splice the audio to seperated sentences and gives us translation text. Foreigners can practice intensive listening and shadowing via this web applicaiton.
